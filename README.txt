Alright.  This is the core project for the Thomas Engine.  NOT THE GAME MADE IN IT.

Within the Thomas project folder is a folder titled, "dependencies".  I dont think I need to tell you what goes in there.
But for ease, thats where we can put everything the project needs so we arent constantly having to relocate other
external libraries.
