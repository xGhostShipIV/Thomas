Thomas the Game Engine was created by: Mathieu Violette, James Sholdice, and Nathan Senter,
and is still a work in progress.

All engine functionality is located in the ThomasTheGameEngine project and is organized
into folders for easier navigation. The h files are all commented for the ease of understanding
the project.

The TestGame project contains code that tests out many of the features within Thomas the Game Engine.
